## 🚀 Overview

PyFlow is an innovative, interactive learning platform that teaches Python programming through hands-on bot development. Unlike traditional coding tutorials, PyFlow uses a concept-atom approach where learners build real, functional bots while mastering fundamental programming concepts.

### ✨ Key Features

- **🧠 Adaptive Learning**: AI-powered recommendations based on your learning style
- **🎯 Interactive Challenges**: Learn by building real bots with API integrations
- **📊 Visual Progress Tracking**: Gamified learning with achievements and streaks
- **🎨 Multiple Learning Modalities**: Video, text, interactive coding, and visual diagrams
- **🔗 Concept Graph Navigation**: Visualize learning paths and dependencies
- **💡 Personalized Experience**: Customizable learning profiles and preferences

## 🎯 Learning Approach

### Concept Atoms
Each learning unit is a self-contained "concept atom" that covers:
- **Core Programming Concepts**: Variables, loops, conditionals, functions
- **API Integration**: Real-world data fetching and processing
- **Bot Development**: Building interactive, conversational programs
- **Best Practices**: Professional coding standards and patterns

### Learning Modes
- **🗺️ Explore Mode**: Learn concepts in any order that interests you
- **🎯 Guided Mode**: Follow AI-recommended learning paths for optimal progression

### Content Modalities
- **📹 Video**: Animated explanations and live coding demonstrations
- **📝 Text**: Detailed explanations with code examples
- **🎮 Interactive**: Hands-on coding challenges and exercises
- **🎧 Audio**: Narrated lessons for auditory learners
- **📊 Diagrams**: Visual flowcharts and concept maps
