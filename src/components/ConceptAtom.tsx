**Step 1: Choose Your Development Environment**

You need a place to write and run Python code. You have several options:
• **Online Editors**: Replit, CodePen, or Trinket (no installation required)
• **Local Installation**: Install Python on your computer with an editor like VS Code
• **IDEs**: PyCharm, Thonny, or IDLE (comes with Python)

Once you pick a platform, you're ready to test it.

**Step 2: Test Your Setup**

Run a small program to confirm Python is available.

**Step 3: Understand the Output**

If you see "Hello, Python!" in your terminal, everything is working.

**Step 4: Experiment**

Try changing the message inside the quotes and run it again. Notice how the output changes—your first interaction with Python!

**Step 5: Preview What's Next**

With your tools ready, you're prepared to learn about bots in the next concept. Keep this program handy—you'll expand on it soon.

**Common Errors**
- `'python' is not recognized` – install Python and check your PATH
- `SyntaxError` from mismatched quotes or parentheses`,
            codeExample: `# Your first Python program
print("Hello, Python!")  # Step 2: test your setup

# Try changing this message
print("I'm learning to code!")  # Step 4: experiment with output

# You can print multiple lines
print("Line 1")  # Step 4: first extra line
print("Line 2")  # Step 4: second extra line
print("Line 3")  # Step 4: third extra line`

**Step 1: Define What a Bot Is**

A bot is a program that automates tasks by following predefined rules. In our context, we're building conversational bots that:
• Accept user input
• Process that input according to programmed logic
• Provide appropriate responses

**Step 2: Understand the Input-Process-Output Model**

Every bot follows this pattern:
1. **Input**: Receive data (text, commands, signals)
2. **Process**: Apply logic to determine the appropriate response
3. **Output**: Return a result (text, actions, API calls)

**Step 3: Identify Bot Applications**

Bots are used for:
• Customer service automation
• Data processing and analysis
• Social media management
• Game automation
• Personal assistants

**Step 4: Plan Your Bot's Purpose**

Before coding, decide what your bot will do. Will it provide information, entertain users, solve problems, or automate tasks?

**Step 5: Connect to Your First Bot**

With the basics of bots understood, you're ready to build one in the next concept. Remember the input-process-output model as you start coding.

**Common Errors**
- Not handling unexpected input
- Trying to build everything at once`,
            codeExample: `# Simple bot demonstration
# Step 2: shows the input-process-output pattern

# Input
user_name = input("What's your name? ")  # Step 2: get user input

# Process
greeting = f"Hello, {user_name}! Welcome to bot programming."  # Step 2: build response

# Output
print(greeting)  # Step 2: display result (Step 5 uses this to connect to the first bot)`

- Variable storage for temporary data
- File systems or databases for persistent data
- Session management for multi-turn conversations

**Event-Driven Programming**: Bots respond to events:
- User messages
- Timer events
- External API responses
- System notifications

**Modular Design**: Well-designed bots separate concerns:
- Input handling
- Business logic
- Output formatting
- External integrations`

            content: `Building on the previous lesson where you learned what a bot is, let's code a real one.

**Step 1: Create a Simple Output Bot**

Start with a bot that just displays a message:

\`\`\`python
print("Hello! I am your first bot.")
print("I'm here to help you learn programming.")
\`\`\`

**Step 2: Add User Input**

Make your bot interactive by accepting user input:

\`\`\`python
user_name = input("What's your name? ")
print(f"Nice to meet you, {user_name}!")
\`\`\`

**Step 3: Implement Basic Decision Making**

Add conditional logic to make your bot respond differently:

\`\`\`python
mood = input("How are you feeling today? (good/bad) ")

if mood == "good":
    print("That's wonderful! I'm glad you're having a good day.")
elif mood == "bad":
    print("I'm sorry to hear that. I hope things improve soon.")
else:
    print("Thanks for sharing. Every day has its ups and downs.")
\`\`\`

**Step 4: Combine Everything**

Put all the pieces together into a complete program that demonstrates input, processing, and output.

**Step 5: Prepare for Variables**

The next concept introduces variables. Keep track of the information your bot collects so you can store it in variables soon.

**Common Errors**
- Forgetting to convert user input types
- Indentation mistakes in if/else blocks`,
            codeExample: `# Complete basic bot example
print("=== Welcome to ChatBot v1.0 ===")  # Step 1: simple output bot
print("I'm a simple bot that can have basic conversations.")  # Step 1 continue

# Get user information
name = input("\\nWhat's your name? ")  # Step 2: gather user input
print(f"Hello, {name}! Nice to meet you.")  # Step 2 feedback

# Ask about their day
mood = input("How has your day been? (great/okay/rough) ")  # Step 2 second input

# Respond based on their input
if mood.lower() == "great":
    print("That's fantastic! I love hearing about good days.")  # Step 3 positive branch
    follow_up = input("What made it so great? ")  # Step 3 ask for details
    print(f"That sounds amazing, {name}!")  # Step 3 response
elif mood.lower() == "okay":
    print("Okay days are perfectly normal. Not every day can be extraordinary.")  # Step 3 neutral branch
elif mood.lower() == "rough":
    print("I'm sorry you've had a tough day. Tomorrow is a fresh start.")  # Step 3 empathetic branch
else:
    print(f"Thanks for sharing, {name}. I appreciate your honesty.")  # Step 3 default branch

            content: `Your bot now collects input from the previous lesson; let's store that information.

**Step 1: Understand Variables as Storage**

Variables are named containers that store data. Think of them as labeled boxes:

\`\`\`python
user_name = "Alice"        # String variable
user_age = 25             # Integer variable
user_height = 5.6         # Float variable
is_student = True         # Boolean variable
\`\`\`

**Step 2: Learn Data Types**

Python has several built-in data types:
• **Strings (str)**: Text data in quotes
• **Integers (int)**: Whole numbers
• **Floats (float)**: Decimal numbers
• **Booleans (bool)**: True or False values

**Step 3: Practice Variable Assignment**

Create variables and observe how they store different types of data.

**Step 4: Modify Variables**

Variables can be updated with new values throughout your program.

**Step 5: Preview Conditional Logic**

You'll soon use variables inside conditional statements. Make sure you understand how to update them so your decisions reflect the latest data.

**Common Errors**
- Mixing string and number types without conversion
- Forgetting quotes around string data`,
            codeExample: `# Comprehensive variable example
print("=== User Profile Bot ===")  # Step 1: program header

# Collect user information
name = input("Enter your name: ")  # Step 3: assign string
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))  # Step 3: convert to int
height = float(input("Enter your height in feet: "))  # Step 3: convert to float
is_student = input("Are you a student? (yes/no): ").lower() == "yes"  # Step 3: boolean value

# Calculate derived information
birth_year = 2024 - age  # Step 4: update data using arithmetic
height_cm = height * 30.48  # Step 4: convert units

# Display profile
print(f"\\n=== Profile for {name} ===")  # Step 3: use variables
print(f"Age: {age} years old")  # Step 3 output
print(f"Birth Year: {birth_year}")  # Step 4 derived value
print(f"Height: {height} feet ({height_cm:.1f} cm)")  # Step 4 converted value
print(f"Student Status: {'Student' if is_student else 'Not a student'}")  # Step 5 preview conditional use

# Demonstrate variable modification
print(f"\\nNext year, {name} will be {age + 1} years old!")  # Step 4 modifying variable

# Show data types
print(f"\\n=== Data Types ===")  # Step 2 heading
print(f"name is a {type(name).__name__}")  # Step 2 show str
print(f"age is a {type(age).__name__}")  # Step 2 show int

            title: 'Tutorial Steps',
            content: `With variables under your belt, it's time to make decisions.

**Step 1: Master Multiple Conditions with elif**

Use elif to check multiple conditions in sequence:

\`\`\`python
score = int(input("Enter your test score: "))

if score >= 90:
    grade = "A"
    message = "Excellent work!"
elif score >= 80:
    grade = "B"
    message = "Good job!"
elif score >= 70:
    grade = "C"
    message = "Satisfactory"
elif score >= 60:
    grade = "D"
    message = "Needs improvement"
else:
    grade = "F"
    message = "Please study more"

print(f"Grade: {grade} - {message}")
\`\`\`

**Step 2: Use Logical Operators**

Combine conditions with and, or, and not:

\`\`\`python
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
has_license = input("Do you have a license? (yes/no): ").lower() == "yes"

if age >= 18 and has_license:
    print("You can drive!")
elif age >= 18 and not has_license:
    print("You're old enough but need a license.")
else:
    print("You're too young to drive.")
\`\`\`

**Step 3: Handle String Comparisons Properly**

Make comparisons case-insensitive and handle variations:

\`\`\`python
answer = input("Do you want to continue? (yes/no): ").lower().strip()

if answer in ["yes", "y", "yeah", "yep"]:
    print("Great! Let's continue.")
elif answer in ["no", "n", "nope", "nah"]:
    print("Okay, stopping here.")
else:
    print("Please answer yes or no.")
\`\`\`

**Step 4: Build Complex Decision Trees**

Create sophisticated logic that handles multiple scenarios and edge cases.

**Step 5: Transition to Loops**

Complex decisions often repeat. In the next concept you'll combine these conditionals with loops to handle ongoing tasks.

**Common Errors**
- Misplacing colons or indentation in if/elif blocks
- Using `=` instead of `==` for comparisons`,
            codeExample: `# Advanced restaurant recommendation bot

            content: `Decisions run once, but bots often repeat work. Loops handle repetition.

**Step 1: Understand For Loops**

For loops repeat code a specific number of times:

\`\`\`python
# Basic counting
for i in range(5):
    print(f"Count: {i}")

# Custom range
for num in range(1, 11):  # 1 to 10
    print(f"Number: {num}")

# Step size
for even in range(0, 21, 2):  # Even numbers 0 to 20
    print(even)
\`\`\`

**Step 2: Master While Loops**

While loops continue until a condition becomes False:

\`\`\`python
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(f"Count is: {count}")
    count += 1  # Important: update the condition variable!

print("Loop finished")
\`\`\`

**Step 3: Create Interactive Loops**

Use loops to create ongoing conversations:

\`\`\`python
print("Chat Bot - Type 'quit' to exit")

while True:
    user_input = input("You: ")
    
    if user_input.lower() == 'quit':
        print("Bot: Goodbye!")
        break
    
    print(f"Bot: You said '{user_input}'. That's interesting!")
\`\`\`

**Step 4: Implement Loop Control**

Use break and continue to control loop execution:

\`\`\`python
for i in range(10):
    if i == 3:
        continue  # Skip this iteration
    if i == 7:
        break     # Exit the loop
print(i)
\`\`\`

**Step 5: Looking Ahead to APIs**

Loops let your bot perform tasks repeatedly. In the next lesson you'll use them to fetch data from APIs over and over.

**Common Errors**
- Forgetting to update loop variables (infinite loops)
- Confusing `break` and `continue``,
            codeExample: `# Advanced chatbot with conversation loop
import random  # Step 1: include randomness

print("=== Advanced ChatBot ===")  # Step 3: intro message

            content: `Now that loops let your bot run repeatedly, let's pull in external data.

**Step 1: Understand the Term API**

API stands for Application Programming Interface

Think of an API as a waiter in a restaurant:
• You (your program) make a request
• The waiter (API) takes your request to the kitchen (external service)
• The kitchen (service) prepares your order (processes the request)
• The waiter brings back your food (returns the data)

**Step 2: Explore Common API Types**
• **Weather APIs**: Get current weather and forecasts
• **News APIs**: Fetch latest news articles
• **Social Media APIs**: Access posts and user data
• **Financial APIs**: Get stock prices and market data
• **Entertainment APIs**: Movies, music, games information

**Step 3: Why Use APIs?**
Instead of building everything from scratch, APIs let you access existing services and data. Want weather information? Use a weather API. Need jokes? Use a joke API.

**Step 4: Get Ready to Call One**

You'll implement actual HTTP requests in the next concept, so keep these examples in mind.

**Common Errors**
- Forgetting to check API status codes
- Parsing JSON without validating the response`,
            codeExample: `# Understanding API concepts with examples

**Common HTTP Methods:**
- **GET**: Retrieve data (like asking for information)
- **POST**: Send data (like submitting a form)
- **PUT**: Update existing data
- **DELETE**: Remove data

**JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)**: The most common data format for APIs

JSON looks like Python dictionaries:
\`\`\`json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": 30,
  "city": "New York",
  "hobbies": ["reading", "coding", "hiking"]
}
\`\`\`

**Status Codes**: Tell you if your request worked
- 200: Success
- 404: Not found
- 500: Server error`

- **icanhazdadjoke**: Random dad jokes
- **Numbers API**: Interesting facts about numbers
- **Cat Facts API**: Random cat facts

**Utility APIs:**
- **Random User API**: Generate fake user profiles
- **Quotable**: Inspirational quotes
- **REST Countries**: Information about countries

**News and Information:**
- **NewsAPI**: Headlines from various sources
- **Wikipedia API**: Access to Wikipedia content

**Weather APIs:**
- **OpenWeatherMap**: Current weather and forecasts
- **WeatherAPI**: Detailed weather information

These APIs are perfect for learning because they're free, well-documented, and don't require complex authentication.`

            title: 'Making Your First API Call',
            content: `You've learned what APIs are. Now let's use them in code.

**Step 1: Install the Requests Library**

The requests library makes HTTP calls simple in Python:

\`\`\`bash
pip install requests
\`\`\`

**Step 2: Import and Make a Basic Request**

\`\`\`python
import requests

response = requests.get("https://api.github.com/users/octocat")
print(f"Status Code: {response.status_code}")
print(f"Response: {response.json()}")
\`\`\`

**Step 3: Handle Responses Properly**

Always check if the request was successful:

\`\`\`python
if response.status_code == 200:
    data = response.json()
    print("Success!")
else:
    print(f"Error: {response.status_code}")
\`\`\`

**Step 4: Add Error Handling**

Make your API calls robust:

\`\`\`python
try:
    response = requests.get(url, timeout=10)
    response.raise_for_status()  # Raises exception for bad status codes
    return response.json()
except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
    print(f"API call failed: {e}")
return None
\`\`\`

**Step 5: Move Toward a Full Bot**

With reliable API calls in place, you're ready to merge all these skills when you create your personalized bot in the final concept.

import requests
from requests.exceptions import RequestException, Timeout, ConnectionError

def safe_api_call(url, **kwargs):

        return {"error": "Invalid JSON response"}
\`\`\`

**Best Practices:**
- Always use timeouts to prevent hanging requests
- Handle different types of errors appropriately
- Use sessions for multiple requests to the same API
- Respect rate limits and add delays if needed
- Cache responses when appropriate to reduce API calls

**API Key Management:**
- Never hardcode API keys in your source code
- Use environment variables or configuration files
- Keep API keys secure and don't share them publicly`

            title: 'Planning Your Bot',
            content: `All previous lessons come together here as you craft a personalized assistant.

**Step 1: Define Your Bot's Purpose**

Before coding, plan your bot's identity:
• **Purpose**: What problem does it solve? (entertainment, productivity, information, etc.)
• **Personality**: Formal, friendly, humorous, professional?
• **Target Audience**: Who will use your bot?
• **Core Features**: What are the 3-5 main things it can do?

**Step 2: Design the User Experience**

Plan how users will interact with your bot:
• **Commands**: What keywords trigger different features?
• **Conversation Flow**: How does the bot guide users?
• **Error Handling**: How does it respond to unexpected input?
• **Help System**: How do users learn what the bot can do?

**Step 3: Choose Your APIs**

Select APIs that match your bot's purpose:
• Weather bots need weather APIs
• Entertainment bots might use joke, quote, or trivia APIs
• News bots need news APIs
• Study bots could use dictionary or educational APIs

**Step 4: Add Personality**

Make your bot memorable with:
• Varied responses using random selection
• Consistent tone and voice
• Helpful error messages
• Encouraging feedback
• Personal touches that reflect your creativity

**Step 5: Final Preparation**

You're almost ready to release your bot. The next concept will walk you through final setup and deployment.

**Common Errors**
- Adding too many features at once
- Forgetting to save conversation history`,
